            <b>Directions:</b>
            <p>This application is designed to provide students with a way of testing their knowledge
            of elements on the periodic table. Within the program a student will be prompted with
            a random element. They will then be required to enter the number of Proton\'s, Electron\'s, and
            neutrons that are in the element.</p>

            <p>Getting the answer right will reward the student with points that will be permanently
            recorded for later reference. If the student beats their all time record it will be
            updated with the new high score.</p>

            <p>The goal is to get the best score possible. Good Luck!</p>
